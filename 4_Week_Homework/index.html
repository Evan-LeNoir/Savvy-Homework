                        <li>The D8 GT (the predecessor to the GTO) is still known as the world's lightest GT Comp' Car due to its extensive use of carbon fibre and next-level architectural engineering with its space-frame.</li>
                        <li>The D8 GT also made Donkervoort a well known and feared staple in the GT class after decimating the competition at 24hrs of Dubai in 2011.</li>

                    <h3>Donkervoort D8 GTO (2013–present)</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.autoweek.nl/m/ocxynf0bqu5z_800.jpg" alt="Photo of the newest GTO 40" height="240" width="360"><p>The GTO was a complete and risky departure from Donkervoort's usual tried and true crafting procedures. In years prior, this model would show up to unveilings at prestigious autoshows such as Geneva, Frankfurt and Michigan but despite how many times they were asked, nothing ever came of it. That all changed in winter of 2013 when Donkervoort announced there would be a new model to replace the aging D8 GT which had become the brand's halo-car and vicious contender in the GT Car completions as well as LéMan. This new model had some big shoes to fill.</p>
                    <p>Starting with the <i>GTO Premium</i>, as a sort of way to test market interest and gain valuable feedback from loyal customers as well as their racing teams, just 25 examples being made. These Premium models received a power bump that surpasses even the current GTO Performance model and loaded to the gills with every option offered at the time. The result was an unexpected monumental success straight out of left field!</p>
